# Databricks Data Integrity with AI/ML

This repository contains practical examples of how to implement AI and ML techniques for ensuring data integrity in large-scale datasets using Databricks. We focus on scalable anomaly detection using distributed processing with Apache Spark, TensorFlow, and MLflow.

## Overview
The repository contains Python scripts for:
- Loading and processing data in micro-batches with Apache Spark.
- Training autoencoder models for anomaly detection.
- Using MLflow to track and manage model artifacts.
- Detecting anomalies in large datasets using distributed data processing.

## Repository Structure

- **notebooks/**: Python scripts for data loading, model training, and anomaly detection.
- **models/**: Autoencoder model definition and utility functions.
- **requirements.txt**: Python dependencies for running the code in this repo.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/databricks-data-integrity.git
    cd databricks-data-integrity
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Set up your Databricks environment:
    - Ensure that you have a running cluster with Apache Spark and MLflow configured.
    - Upload the scripts to your Databricks workspace or run them as Databricks Jobs.

## Scripts

### 1. `load_data_batches.py`
Loads large datasets from Delta Lake or S3 into Apache Spark DataFrames and processes them in micro-batches to avoid memory overflow.

### 2. `train_autoencoder.py`
Defines and trains an autoencoder model using TensorFlow on each micro-batch of data. Models are saved and tracked using MLflow.

### 3. `detect_anomalies.py`
Uses the trained autoencoder models to detect anomalies in large datasets. Anomalies are flagged based on reconstruction error.

### 4. `mlflow_logging.py`
Handles MLflow logging for model tracking, including storing and retrieving model artifacts.

## How to Run

1. Load your data:
    ```python
    python notebooks/load_data_batches.py
    ```

2. Train the autoencoder on micro-batches:
    ```python
    python notebooks/train_autoencoder.py
    ```

3. Detect anomalies in the dataset:
    ```python
    python notebooks/detect_anomalies.py
    ```
